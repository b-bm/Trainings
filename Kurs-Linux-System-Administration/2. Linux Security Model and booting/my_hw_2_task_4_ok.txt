4. Write down at least 3 Linux file systems optimized especially for Flash drives(SD cards, USB Drives, SSD disks).

F2FS –> Flash-Friendly File System. An open source Linux file system introduced by Samsung in 2012. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2FS

JFFS –> Original log structured Linux file system for NOR flash media
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFFS

JFFS2 –> Successor of JFFS, for NAND and NOR flash
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFFS2

LogFS –> Intended to replace JFFS2, better scalability. In early development.

UBIFS –> Successor of JFFS2 optimized to utilize non-volatile DRAM
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBIFS

NILFS –> Linux implementation of a log-structured file system 
NILFS is especially designed for flash memory drives, but does not really perform better than ext4 on benchmarks.

Btrfs -> is still considered experimental -> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs

EXT4, EXT4 + TRIM:
Ext4 is the most common Linux filesystem (well maintained). 
It provides good performance with SSD and supports the TRIM (and FITRIM) feature to keep good SSD performance over time (this clears unused memory blocks for quick later write access).
