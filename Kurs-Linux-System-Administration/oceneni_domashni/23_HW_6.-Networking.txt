11. Describe the difference between dhclient and dhcpcd.

dhcpcd - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server
dhcpd, implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and be assigned IP addresses, and also to discover information about the network to which they are attached. BOOTP provides similar functionality, with certain restrictions.

dhclient - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client
dhclient provides a means for configuring one or more network interfaces using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an address.

If we can make parallel with client server technology, dhcpcd is the server and dhclient is the client.
