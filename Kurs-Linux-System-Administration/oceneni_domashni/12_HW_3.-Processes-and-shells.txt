" /proc/[pid]/fd
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file  which
              the process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is
              a symbolic link to the actual file.  Thus, 0 is standard  input,
              1 standard output, 2 standard error, etc. "
