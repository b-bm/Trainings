3. Describe the SMACK security model.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smack

Smack is a Linux kernel security module that protects data and process interaction from malicious manipulation using a set of custom mandatory access control rules, with simplicity as its main design goal.[1] It has been officially merged since the Linux 2.6.25 release,[2] and was the main access control mechanism for the MeeGo mobile Operating System.[3][4] It is also used to sandbox HTML5 web applications in the Tizen architecture,[5] in the commercial Wind River Linux solutions for embedded device development,[6][7] and in Philips Digital TV products.[8]
