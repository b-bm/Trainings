ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS
       path [ N ]
              Lists  all  paths  with  devices/project  identifiers or set the
              current path to the Nth list entry (the current path is used  by
              many   of   the  commands  described  here,  it  identifies  the
              filesystem toward which a command is directed).  The patch  list
              can  come  from  several  places  -  the command line, the mount
              table, and the /etc/projects file.

       report [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] [ -ahntLNU ] [ -f file ]
              Report filesystem quota information.   This  reports  all  quota
              usage  for  a  filesystem,  for  the specified quota type (u/g/p
              and/or blocks/inodes/realtime).  It reports blocks in 1KB  units
              by  default.  The -h option reports in a "human-readable" format
              similar to the df(1) command. The -f option outputs  the  report
              to  file  instead  of  stdout.  The  -a  option  reports  on all
              filesystems. The -n option outputs the numeric ID instead of the
              name. The -L and -U options specify lower and upper ID bounds to
              report on. The -N option reports information without the  header
              line. The -t option performs a terse report.

       state [ -gpu ] [ -av ] [ -f file ]
              Report  overall  quota  state  information.  This reports on the
              state of quota accounting, quota enforcement, and the number  of
              extents  being used by quota metadata within the filesystem. The
              -f option outputs state information to file instead  of  stdout.
              The  -a option reports state on all filesystems and not just the
              current path.

       limit [ -gpu ] bsoft=N | bhard=N | isoft=N  |  ihard=N  |  rtbsoft=N  |
              rtbhard=N -d | id | name
              Set   quota  block  limits  (bhard/bsoft),  inode  count  limits
              (ihard/isoft) and/or realtime  block  limits  (rtbhard/rtbsoft).
              The  -d  option  (defaults) can be used to set the default value
              that will be used, otherwise a specific user/group/project  name
              or numeric identifier must be specified.

       timer [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] value
              Allows  the  quota  enforcement timeout (i.e. the amount of time
              allowed to pass before the soft limits are enforced as the  hard
              limits)  to  be  modified.  The  current  timeout setting can be
              displayed using the state  command.  The  value  argument  is  a
              number  of seconds, but units of ’minutes’, ’hours’, ’days’, and
              ’weeks’ are also understood (as  are  their  abbreviations  ’m’,
              ’h’, ’d’, and ’w’).

       warn [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] value -d | id | name
              Allows  the  quota  warnings  limit  (i.e. the number of times a
              warning will be send to someone over quota)  to  be  viewed  and
              modified.  The  -d  option  (defaults)  can  be  used to set the
              default  time  that  will  be   used,   otherwise   a   specific
              user/group/project name or numeric identifier must be specified.
              NOTE: this feature is not currently implemented.

       enable [ -gpu ] [ -v ]
              Switches on quota enforcement for the filesystem  identified  by
              the  current  path.   This  requires the filesystem to have been
              mounted with quota enabled, and for accounting to  be  currently
              active.  The  -v  option  (verbose) displays the state after the
              operation has completed.

       disable [ -gpu ] [ -v ]
              Disables  quota  enforcement,  while  leaving  quota  accounting
              active.  The  -v  option  (verbose) displays the state after the
              operation has completed.

       off [ -gpu ] [ -v ]
              Permanently switches quota off for the filesystem identified  by
              the   current   path.   Quota  can  only  be  switched  back  on
              subsequently by unmounting and then mounting again.

       remove [ -gpu ] [ -v ]
              Remove any space allocated to quota metadata from the filesystem
              identified  by  the  current path.  Quota must not be enabled on
              the filesystem, else this operation will report an error.

       dump [ -gpu ] [ -f file ]
              Dump out quota limit information for backup utilities, either to
              standard  output  (default)  or  to  a  file.   This is only the
              limits, not the usage information, of course.

       restore [ -gpu ] [ -f file ]
              Restore quota limits from a backup file.  The file  must  be  in
              the format produced by the dump command.

       quot [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] [ -acnv ] [ -f file ]
              Summarize filesystem ownership, by user, group or project.  This
              command uses a special XFS "bulkstat" interface to quickly  scan
              an entire filesystem and report usage information.  This command
              can be used even when filesystem quota are not enabled, as it is
              a full-filesystem scan (it may also take a long time...). The -a
              option displays information on all filesystems.  The  -c  option
              displays a histogram instead of a report. The -n option displays
              numeric IDs rather than names. The -v  option  displays  verbose
              information.  The  -f  option send the output to file instead of
              stdout.

       project [ -cCs id | name ]
              Without arguments, this command lists known  project  names  and
              identifiers   (based   on   entries  in  the  /etc/projects  and
              /etc/projid files).  The  -c,  -C,  and  -s  options  allow  the
              directory tree quota mechanism, discussed in detail below, to be
              maintained.

# xfs_check ;
	-check the system.

# xfs_repair ;
	-In some cases, XFS filesystem corruption, even on the root file system, can be repaired
with the command.

# xfsdump_quotas ;
	-If the filesystem being dumped contains quotas, xfsdump will use repquota(1M) to
store the quotas in the following files in the root of the filesystem to be dumped.

# xfsdump_quotas_group ; 
	
# xfsrestore ;
	-detects and bypasses media errors and recovers rapidly after encountering them. 

# xfsdump ;
	-You can use to back up data to various media.

# xfsrestore ;
	-Use xfsrestore to restore data backed up with xfsdump. You can restore files,
subdirectories, and filesystems—regardless of the way they were backed up.;
