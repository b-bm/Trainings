Increasing the size of a ReiserFS system: = 19. Describe the procedure of resizing ReiserFS. ??

can be increased in size while mounted or unmounted
Open a termina console,then log in as root user or equvalent.

Increase the size of the fs on the device called /dev/sda2, using on of the following methods: to extend he fs to the maximum available size of the device - resize_reiserfs /dev/sda2
when no size is specified, this increases the volume to the full size of the partition. 
to extend the fs to a spec. size - resize_reiserfs -s size /dev/sda2
replace size with a desirable siez in bytes. u can also specify units on the value, such as 50000k, 250M, 2G and so on. U can specify an increase to the current size by prefixing the value with (+) sign:
resize_reiserfs -s +500M /dev/sda2
wait until completed

To mount ReiserFS for device ... at mount point ---:
mount -t reiserfs ... ---
Verify:
df -h


Decreasing the size of ReiserFS:
it can be done only if the volume is unmounted. 
-Unmount the device: umount /mnt/point
If the partition you are attempitng to decrease in size contains system files such as /, unmount is possible only when booting from a bootable CD or other.
Devreasing the size of the file system on a device called /dev/--- :
resize_reiserfs -s size /dev/---
Replace sizewith desired size in byes (ot M, G, Kbytes so on) and adding (-):
resize_reiserfs -s -500M /dev/---
wait until it is completed.
Mount the file system :
mount -t reiserfs /dev/--- /mnt/point
Verify:
df -h

When want to use free space from VG:
lvextended -L+5G /dev/vg(number)/lv_slot_(something)
df -h

resize with it still mounted:
resize_reiserfs -f /dev/vg(num)/lv_slot_(smth)
df -h

Сравнително добро домашно, изчерпателно не видях само източник на информацията. Би било добре да се посочва.
Успех за напред.
