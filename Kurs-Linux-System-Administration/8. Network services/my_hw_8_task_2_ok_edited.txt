2. Configure DHCPD to do remote dynamic dns updates.

DHCP Server Configuration

Additionally you have to configure your DHCP server to update these zones. 
To do so, you need to edit the file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf. This file consists of different sections. 
In the global section, which is everything that is not inside a Subnet-, or group block, you have to add the following:

	option domain-name "example.org";

	ddns-updates           on;
	ddns-update-style      interim;
	ignore                 client-updates;
	update-static-leases   on;

option domain-name:
This options specifies the domain name, which is also used for DDNS.

ddns-update-style:
This option should always be interim. The only other option is adhoc, but that one is outdated .

client-updates:
If you use the option allow client-updates, the clients are allowed to register their name at the DNS server by themselves. 
We don't want this, so I added ignore client-updates (which is already the default option), just to show this explicitly.

update-static-leases:
By default the DHCP-Server doesn't update the DNS entries of static leases. 
If you want it to update them, you need to set this option to on. 
It can be that this causes some problems, that's why the manpage of dhcpd.conf doesn't recommend the use of it. 
If you experience problems, turn it off, but then you have to configure these hosts statically not only for DHCP, but also for DNS.

You have to add the following lines for the zones that shall be updated by your DHCP server. 

	include "/etc/dhcp/ddns.key";

	zone example.org. {
	  primary 127.0.0.1;
	  key DDNS_UPDATE;
	}

	zone 2.168.192.in-addr.arpa. {
	  primary 127.0.0.1;
	  key DDNS_UPDATE;
	}

The primary statement specifies the IP address of the name server whose zone information is to be updated. 
In this case DHCP and DNS server are running on the same machine, that's why we put 127.0.0.1 there. 
If that's not the case, you have to put the IP address of the machine that the DNS server is running on there. 
The zone descriptions have to end with a period.

The complete dhcpd.conf file after the previous steps and with a basic configuration for the subnet 192.168.2.0/24: 

	authoritative;
	option domain-name "example.org";
	option domain-name-servers ns.example.org;

	ddns-updates on;
	ddns-update-style interim;
	ignore client-updates;
	update-static-leases on;

	default-lease-time 600;
	max-lease-time 7200;
	log-facility local7;


	include "/etc/dhcp/ddns.key";

	zone EXAMPLE.ORG. {
	  primary 127.0.0.1;
	  key DDNS_UPDATE;
	}

	zone 2.168.192.in-addr.arpa. {
	  primary 127.0.0.1;
	  key DDNS_UPDATE;
	}


	subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
			range 192.168.2.10 192.168.2.100;
			option routers 192.168.2.1;
	}

Restart the servers

	root# /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart
	root# /etc/init.d/bind9 restart
