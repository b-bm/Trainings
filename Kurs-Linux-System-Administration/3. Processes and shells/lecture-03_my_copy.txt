I. What is a process ? -> бележка: видео 2 = 08.30 мин. до ~  мин. бележка: END //

A process is an executed copy of a binary executable file.
The prcoesses in Linux have Process IDs - PID
They are separated in three modes
 * kernel - process that runs inside the kernel
 * user   - process that is descendant of init
 * guest  - process that is actualy a guest operating system

In Linux the user processes are three types:
 * Forground - a process that is connected to the console and has its standard output displayied on the console
 * Background - a process that is connected to the console but has its standard output and/or error hidden from the console
 * Daemon - a processe that is not associated with any console

Difference between a process and a thread
 * The process has its own memory
 * The thread shares its memory with other threads

 * The processes has its own pid
 * The threads share the pid of their parents

 * The process is, by its nature, a single threaded application



Process security
 * Real UID/GID
 * Effective UID/GID
 * Saved UID/GID

Capabilities
 - CAP_SYS_ADMIN - the new root
 - Permitted (formerly known as forced): These capabilities are automatically permitted to the thread, regardless of the thread's inheritable capabilities.
 - Inheritable (formerly known as allowed): This set is ANDed with the thread's inheritable set to determine which inheritable capabilities are enabled in the permitted set of the thread after the execve(2).
 - Effective: If this bit is set, then during an execve(2) all of the new permitted capabilities for the thread are also raised in the effective set.
 - Transformation of Capabilities During execve()
   During an execve(2), the kernel calculates the new capabilities of the process using the following algorithm:

           P'(permitted) = (P(inheritable) & F(inheritable)) | (F(permitted) & cap_bset)

           P'(effective) = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : 0

           P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

	P  - the capabilities before the process was started
	P' - the capabilities after the process was started
	F  - file capabilities
