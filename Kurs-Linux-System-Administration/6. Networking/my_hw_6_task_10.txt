HW - 6:

10. Configure static MAC to IP address mapping using iproute2.


РОВЕРИ ДАЛИ Е ВЯРНО ЗА ПОСОЧЕНОТО УСЛОВИЕ !!!

In some situations, static addressing assignments are useful (e.g., to make address spoofing more difficult). 
Additionally, selectively preventing access to hosts with an intentionally incorrect link-layer address means a host cannot be addressed. 
If you want to assign the IP address 10.1.1.1 to a fixed MAC address of 00:d0:a7:b1:c7:de on eth1, the following command will do the trick:

~# ip neigh add 10.1.1.1 lladdr 00:d0:a7:b1:c7:de dev eth1 nud perm

Here, nud stands for Neighbor Unreachability Detection, a mechanism that was introduced in IPv6 but that can also set the status of an entry in IPv4. 
Conversely, an entry can also be removed using:

~# ip neigh del 10.1.1.1 dev eth1
