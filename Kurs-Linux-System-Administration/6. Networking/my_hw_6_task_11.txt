11. Describe the difference between dhclient and dhcpcd.

dhclient - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client:
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client, dhclient, provides a means for configuring one or more network interfaces using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an address. 
On startup, dhclient reads the dhclient.conf for configuration instructions. It then gets a list of all the network interfaces that are configured in the current system. 
For each interface, it attempts to configure the interface using the DHCP protocol. 
In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and server restarts, dhclient keeps a list of leases it has been assigned in the dhclient.leases file. 
On startup, after reading the dhclient.conf file, dhclient reads the dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases it has been assigned. 

dhcpcd - DHCP client daemon:
dhcpcd is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in RFC2131 (when -r option is not specified) and RFC1541 (when -r option is specified).
It gets the host information (IP address, netmask, broadcast address, etc.) from a DHCP server and configures the network interface of the machine on which it is running. 
It also tries to renew the lease time according to RFC2131 or RFC1541 (obsolete).  
The dhcpcd daemon is normally started by the /etc/rc.tcpip file that normally runs at boot time. 
By default, this is commented out and not run on machine startup. There are smit options to enable the DHCP client.
The dhcpcd daemon reads its configuration file and attempts to bring up and get an IP address and other configuration options for the interfaces specified within the configuration file. 
The dhcpcd daemon runs in the background while the system is up. It will renew an already received address as required.

dhclient is a one-shot client - it reaches out to a server once and only once to request or validate a client's IP address.
In contrast, dhcpcd runs in background and actively manages re-requests after expired lease time etc. pp. without needing to be called again.
dhclient е dhcp клиент, това е еднократно изпълнима програма по подразбиране, която може да се ползва и като постоянен демон.
dhcpcd също е dhcp клиент предоставен от ISC, но той е постоянна услуга по подразбиране.
