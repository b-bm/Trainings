1. Describe the idea of the Group Policy feature. Try to find any non-Microsoft softwares that provide Group Policy Administrative Templates.

	*** Describe the idea of the Group Policy feature *** :
Group Policy is simply the easiest way to reach out and configure computer and user settings on networks based on Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). 
If your business is not using Group Policy, you are missing a huge opportunity to reduce costs, control configurations, keep users productive and happy, and harden security. 
Think of Group Policy as “touch once, configure many.”
The requirements for using Group Policy and following the instructions that this white paper provides are straightforward:

	- The network must be based on AD DS (that is, at least one server must have the AD DS role installed). 
	  To learn more about AD DS, see Active Directory Domain Services Overview on TechNet.

	- Computers that you want to manage must be joined to the domain, and users that you want to manage must use domain credentials to log on to their computers.

	- You must have permission to edit Group Policy in the domain.

Although this white paper focuses on using Group Policy in AD DS, you can also configure Group Policy settings locally on each computer. 
This capability is great for one-off scenarios or workgroup computers, but using local Group Policy is not recommended for business networks based on AD DS. 
The reason is simple: Domain-based Group Policy centralizes management, so you can touch many computers from one place. 
Local Group Policy requires that you touch each computer—not an ideal scenario in a large environment. 
For more information about configuring local Group Policy, see Local Group Policy Editor (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc725970.aspx?ITPID=article) on TechNet.
