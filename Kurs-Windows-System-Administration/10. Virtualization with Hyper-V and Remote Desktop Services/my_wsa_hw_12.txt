5. Find and document as much as possible for Microsoft® RemoteFX™ technology.

RemoteFX is a set of protocols for Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that are used to remotely deliver Windows virtual desktops over a local area network (LAN ). 
The virtual desktops are hosted on a Windows server in the data center.
RemoteFX technologies deliver a higher-quality user experience than RDP alone because they have advanced coding and graphics virtualization. 
A virtual desktop delivered through RemoteFX allows the end user to work remotely in a Windows Aero desktop environment, watch videos and run 3-D applications with performance that is close to a native desktop experience.
RemoteFX was delivered as part of Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1. 
It can be compared to other virtual desktop protocols, such as VMware PC over IP (PCoIP) and Citrix HDX.
