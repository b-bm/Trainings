2. Find and document information for the LDAP protocol. Provide information for some applications that are integrated with the LDAP protocol.

LDAP or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol:

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP; /ˈɛldæp/) is an application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
Directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. 
Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.
LDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1. 
The latest specification is Version 3, published as RFC 4511.

For example, here is an LDAP search translated into plain English: 
"Search in the company email directory for all people located in Boston whose name contains 'Jesse' that have an email address. Please return their full name, email, title, and description."
A common usage of LDAP is to provide a "single sign-on" where one password for a user is shared between many services, such as applying a company login code to web pages 
(so that staff log in only once to company computers, and then are automatically logged into the company intranet)

LDAP Application Program Interface:

The LDAP Application Program Interface, described by RFC 1823(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1823),is an Informational RFC that specifies an application programming interface in the C programming language for version 2 of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. 
Version 2 of LDAP is historic. Commonly available LDAP C APIs do not strictly adhere to this specification.

List of LDAP software:
The following is a list of software programs that can communicate with and/or host directory services via the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

Cross-platform:
Apache Directory Server/Studio -> an LDAP browser and directory client for Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows, and as a plug-in for the Eclipse development environment.
FusionDirectory -> a web application under license GNU General Public License developed in PHP for managing LDAP directory and associated services.
JXplorer -> a Java-based browser that runs in any operating environment.
LDAP Account Manager -> a PHP based webfrontend for managing various account types in an LDAP directory.
phpLDAPadmin -> a web-based LDAP administration tool for creating and editing LDAP entries in any LDAP server.

Microsoft Windows:
Active Directory Explorer -> a free LDAP client tool from Microsoft. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Explorer
LDAP Admin -> a free, open source LDAP directory browser and editor. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldap_admin
