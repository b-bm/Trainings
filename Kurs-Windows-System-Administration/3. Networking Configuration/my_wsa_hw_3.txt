5. Describe how the APIPA (IPv4) Auto-Configuration works. 
Provides additional information what is the mechanism used to prevent duplicate IP Address.

Въведение: 
Link-local address
In a computer network, a link-local address is a network address that is intended and valid only for communications within a network segment (a single network link, or often: one broadcast domain) that a host is connected to.
Usually, link-local addresses are not guaranteed to be unique beyond a single network segment. In comparison, other classes of addresses like organisation-wide or world-wide (or global) addresses, are unique within an organisation, or even world-wide. 
Routers therefore do not forward packets with link-local addresses.
The term link-local address would normally be used in cases where a protocol also supports non-link-local (e.g. global) addresses (like IPv4). 
For protocols that support only link-local addresses (like Ethernet, USB), the plain term 'address' suffices.
Link-local addresses for IPv4 are defined in the address block 169.254.0.0/16, in CIDR notation.

На кратко какво е APIPA:

Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
When a globally routable or a private address becomes available after a link-local address has been assigned, the use of the new address should generally be preferred to the link-local address for new connections but communication via the link-local address is still possible.
Microsoft refers to this address autoconfiguration method as Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). 
It is sometimes also casually referred to as auto-IP.
